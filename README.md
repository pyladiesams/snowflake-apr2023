In this session, you will learn how Snowflake can enable and accelerate end-to-end Data Science workflows. We will train and deploy a model using the Snowpark library for Python and build a Streamlit app that allows business users to consume the results of our model predictions in a simple web app - all using pure Python, without any front-end experience required.
